# Searching_for_string_hits
The Amber Heard trial segment motivated this.  One witness was questioned about whether instead of the search hit "fake sexual violence" would miss the term "faked sexual violence" or if the permutation of the words would be accounted for in their search, and he astoundingly replied, "it would not have".
